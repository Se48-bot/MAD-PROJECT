## PWA (installable web app)
- Files added: `manifest.webmanifest`, `service-worker.js`, `pwa-register.js`
- Homepage `<head>` now links the manifest and registers the SW.

How to test locally (simple):
1. Serve over HTTPS or use a local web server.
2. Open `New folder (10)/Agro-Connect-Hub-Ghana.html`.
3. In Chrome: Application tab â†’ Manifest shows install prompt when criteria met.

## Capacitor (Android/iOS wrapper)
1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. In project root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run cap:init # initializes if needed
   npm run cap:add:android
   npm run cap:add:ios  # optional on macOS with Xcode
   npm run cap:sync
   npm run cap:open:android  # opens Android Studio
   # or
   npm run cap:open:ios      # opens Xcode
   ```
3. Build/sign with the native IDEs.

Notes:
- `capacitor.config.ts` uses `New folder (10)` as the web directory.
- Replace the icon URLs in `manifest.webmanifest` with your own assets when ready.
